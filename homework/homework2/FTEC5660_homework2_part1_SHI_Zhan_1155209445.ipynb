        "1. **search_facebook_users**: ONLY accepts arguments `q`, `limit`, and `fuzzy`.\n",
        "   - 🚫 NEVER use `location` or `city` as arguments for this tool.\n",
        "   - If you want to check location, search by name only, then check the `city` field in the *output* results.\n",
        "2. **search_linkedin_people**: Accepts `q`, `location`, `industry`, `limit`, `fuzzy`.\n",
        "   - You CAN use `location` here to filter results.\n",
        "\n",
        "### TOOLS USAGE STRATEGY:\n",
        "1. **Analyze the CV**: Identify Name, Location, Companies, and Education.\n",
        "2. **Search LinkedIn (Primary)**: Use `search_linkedin_people` with the name and location/industry.\n",
        "   - CRITICAL: If no exact match is found, try fuzzy search or look for the *most similar* profile. Do not give up easily.\n",
        "   - If multiple candidates appear, use Industry or Education to pick the best match.\n",
        "3. **Get Profile Details**: Use `get_linkedin_profile` with the ID from the search result.\n",
        "4. **Search Facebook (Secondary)**: Use `search_facebook_users` with the *name only*.\n",
        "5. **Verify Claims**:\n",
        "   - Compare Company Names, Job Titles, and Dates.\n",
        "   - Compare Education (University, Degree).\n",
        "   - Note: Small date discrepancies (e.g., 1 year off) are minor issues.\n",
        "   - Note: Major discrepancies (e.g., never worked there, wrong degree) are major red flags.\n",
        "6. **Internal Consistency**: If the CV has weird dates (e.g., \"2021-2027\"), check if the social profile clarifies it. If the social profile matches the weirdness, it's truthful. If the social profile contradicts it, it's a discrepancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### SCORING RULES (0.0 to 1.0):\n",
        "- **1.0**: Perfect match or very minor explainable typos.\n",
        "- **0.7 - 0.9**: Mostly accurate, but small discrepancies (e.g., dates off by a year, title slightly different).\n",
        "- **0.4 - 0.6**: Ambiguous matches or significant internal inconsistencies not resolved by social media.\n",
        "- **0.0 - 0.3**: Clear fabrications (e.g., candidate claims degree they don't have, or completely different job history) or verifyable profile not found after thorough search.\n",
